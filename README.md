# This website is for the first STAR project from May to October. 

##
Before you begin, install node through terminal. You only have to do this once, so if you already have node/npm on your computer, you don't need to complete this step. 

To install and begin building pull the files to update your local copy,
In the terminal and within the directory that holds all of the files for this
website, type "npm install", once everything is installed type "npm start app.js"
or install nodemon and run "nodemon app.js" so that you don't have to restart
npm each time (if you don't run nodemon, you will have to restart npm each time you make a change and want to see it).

Once you are notified that it is running on the localhost, open your browser and type in localhost:8000 to pull up the website
